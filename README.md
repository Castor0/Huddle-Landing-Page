# Huddle-Landing-Page

This page was created during my 100 days of coding 
It is a challenge from Frontend Mentor.io
I used Html and css in the creation of this page
The creation of the icons in the bottom-left posed a major issue for me but i overcame that by using flex-end to move the icons top the desirable pposition.
i did some research on youtube and google in the process of the project
